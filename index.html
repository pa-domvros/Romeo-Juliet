<h2>🗂️ Lesson Stages (40′ total)</h2>
<h3>1) 🎬💬 Hook &amp; Context (4′) — Text User</h3>
<p><b>Step 1 – Cultural Check (0:00–0:45):</b> “Do you know who Romeo and Juliet were?” Quick responses → Summarise: “Famous teenage couple, enemies’ families; love, obstacles, big decisions.”</p>
<p><b>Step 2 – Immediate Immersion (0:45–2:15):</b> Play <b>Puppy Love</b> trailer (no intro). Students notice relationships, feelings, actions.</p>
<p><b>Step 3 – First Reactions (2:15–2:45):</b> “What kind of relationship?” “What emotions?” Keep it spontaneous.</p>
<p><b>Step 4 – Guided Connection (2:45–3:30):</b> “What do these characters have in common with R&amp;J?” Guide to obstacles, others’ opinions, impulsive choices, strong emotions.</p>
<p><b>Step 5 – Interactive Checklist (3:30–4:00):</b> Project the HTML checklist (true + distractors). Instant green/red feedback; purpose = spot accurate thematic links.</p>
<h3>2) 🧩📜 Code Breaker: Shakespeare Scene (6′) — Code Breaker</h3>
<p><b>Setup:</b> Show balcony scene (original + modern subtitles). Brief context per line.</p>
<p><b>Activity:</b> Display HTML Code Breaker (5 extracts → meaning). Same 5 for all → whole-class. Groups confer → nominate. Instant full-card green/red. Teacher reinforces and links back to the hook themes.</p>
<h3>3) 🧠❤️ Modern Perspectives (Plato excerpt) — Meaning Maker (7′)</h3>
<p>Play/recap TED-Ed Plato excerpt (Aristophanes’ myth: the “missing half”).</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the <b>Plato Vocabulary Match</b> (12⇄12, instant feedback, live score, reset).</li>
<li><b>All groups:</b> write 3 original sentences using 3 different terms.</li>
<li><b>Differentiation:</b>
<ul>
<li>G1: Sketch humans before the split (label 2 features).</li>
<li>G2: Sketch a modern “missing half” moment + 1 caption with a target term.</li>
<li>G3: 2–3 media examples using soulmate/missing-half; 1 sentence each.</li>
<li>G4: 3 pros &amp; 3 cons of the “missing half” idea (use opinion starters).</li>
<li>G5: “Modern Meme for Plato” — a one-line teen-friendly caption with a target term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>4) 🖼️🗣️ Group Task: Love &amp; Labels Then/Now (15′) — Text Analyst</h3>
<p><b>Aim:</b> Connect Plato → R&amp;J → modern teen experiences (love, labels, identity).</p>
<p><b>Step 1 (1′):</b> Launch the Mini-Poster Builder; explain 4 parts: Plato in our words • 1–2 balcony quotes that connect • a modern example (incl. Puppy Love or real life) • at least two opinion phrases.</p>
<p><b>Step 2 (2′):</b> Scaffold: show quote bank &amp; word limits (40–60 words/section). Use opinion frames.</p>
<p><b>Step 3 (10′):</b> Groups create posters. Teacher circulates: check Plato clarity, quote-to-claim fit, specific vocabulary, past↔present link.</p>
<p><b>Step 4:</b> Timer ⏱️; completion meter goes green when all 4 parts done.</p>
<p><b>Step 5 (2′):</b> Print/save posters. Optional: 2–3 quick shares or gallery walk.</p>
<p><b>Assessment focus:</b> Understanding Plato • R&amp;J accuracy • Relevance to labels/identity • Opinion language clarity.</p>
<h3>5) 🗣️ Presentations &amp; Class Discussion (6′)</h3>
<p>Each group presents for ~1′. Class asks one follow-up. Teacher prompts: “Which philosopher’s idea is closest to your own view of love?”</p>
<h3>6) 🎁 Wrap-up (2′)</h3>
<p><b>Vocabulary recap:</b> jealous, perfection, reject, identity, stereotype, authentic love. <b>Feedback:</b> Students complete the feedback form.</p>
